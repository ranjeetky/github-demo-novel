I want
ed no more riotous excursions with privileged
glimpses into the human heart. Only Catsby, the man
who gives his name to this book, was exempt from
my reaction—Catsby who represented everything for
which I have an unaffect
ed scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of
successful gestures, then there was something
gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to
the promises of life, as if he were related to one of
those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten
thousand miles away. This responsiveness had
nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which
is dignified under the name of the ‘creative
temperament’— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a
romantic readiness such as I have never found in any
other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find
again. No—Catsby turned out all right at the end; it is
Catsby
